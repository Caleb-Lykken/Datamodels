Oracle Database is a commercial relational database management system that supports the relational model. It was developed by Oracle and allowed users to deploy to connect to non Oracle databases. Oracle Database can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud, or as a service, and offers various hosting models. Java and Python can access Oracle Database through JDBC and Python's cx_Oracle library.
