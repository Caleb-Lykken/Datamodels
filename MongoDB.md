MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL document database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It was developed by Alfons Kemper.MongoDB follows the document database model, which involves working with data that is associated with key value pairs, relational objects, graph and geospatial. MongoDB can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or as a service, and offers various hosting models. Java and Python can access MongoDB through the official drivers or client libraries, as well as third-party libraries.
